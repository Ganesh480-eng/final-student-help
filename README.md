## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Courses
Edit the `script.js` file and add new courses to the filter options:

```javascript
// In the HTML select elements, add new options
<option value="New Course">New Course</option>
```

### Modifying Sample Data
Update the `studyMaterials` array in `script.js` to add or modify materials:

```javascript
let studyMaterials = [
    {
        id: 7,
        title: "Your New Material",
        course: "Your Course",
        year: "2024",
        semester: "1",
        fileType: "pdf",
        fileName: "your_file.pdf",
        description: "Your description",
        uploadDate: "2024-01-01",
        size: "1.0 MB"
    }
    // ... more materials
];
```

### Styling Changes
Modify `index.css` to customize colors, fonts, and layout:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #667eea;
    --secondary-color: #764ba2;
    --success-color: #28a745;
    --error-color: #dc3545;
}
```

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive and works on:
- **Desktop**: Full-featured experience with sidebar navigation
- **Tablet**: Optimized layout with touch-friendly elements
- **Mobile**: Stacked layout with mobile-optimized navigation

## 🔒 Security Notes

⚠️ **Important**: This is a front-end prototype with simulated functionality:

- **Authentication**: Uses hardcoded credentials (not secure for production)
- **File Storage**: Files are not actually uploaded to a server
- **Data Persistence**: Uses browser localStorage (cleared when browser data is cleared)
- **No Backend**: All data is stored locally in the browser

For production use, you would need:
- Server-side authentication
- Secure file storage (cloud or server)
- Database for persistent data
- HTTPS for secure communication

## 🎨 Design Features

- **Modern Gradient Background**: Beautiful purple-blue gradient
- **Card-based Layout**: Clean, organized material cards
- **Smooth Animations**: Hover effects and transitions
- **Color-coded File Types**: Different colors for different file formats
- **Professional Typography**: Clean, readable fonts
- **Consistent Spacing**: Well-organized layout with proper spacing

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for a full production system:
- Real backend integration
- User registration system
- Advanced search functionality
- File sharing between students
- Progress tracking
- Calendar integration
- Mobile app version
- Real-time notifications
- Admin panel for teachers
